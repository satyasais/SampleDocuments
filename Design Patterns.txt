Advantage of design pattern:
They are reusable in multiple projects.
They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
They capture the software engineering experiences.
They provide transparency to the design of an application.
They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
Design patterns don?t guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.
When should we use the design patterns?
We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).



Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide solutions to instantiate an Object in the best possible way for specific situations.

1. Singleton Pattern
The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a Class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine. The implementation of the singleton pattern has always been a controversial topic among developers

Java Singleton Pattern Implementation
To implement a singleton pattern, we have different approaches, but all of them have the following common concepts.

Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for the outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.

8. Serialization and Singleton

1. Eager initialization:

package com.journaldev.singleton;

public class EagerInitializedSingleton {

    private static final EagerInitializedSingleton instance = new EagerInitializedSingleton();

    // private constructor to avoid client applications using the constructor
    private EagerInitializedSingleton(){}

    public static EagerInitializedSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}

2. Static block initialization:

package com.journaldev.singleton;

public class StaticBlockSingleton {

    private static StaticBlockSingleton instance;

    private StaticBlockSingleton(){}

    // static block initialization for exception handling
    static {
        try {
            instance = new StaticBlockSingleton();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Exception occurred in creating singleton instance");
        }
    }

    public static StaticBlockSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}

3. Lazy Initialization:

package com.journaldev.singleton;

public class LazyInitializedSingleton {

    private static LazyInitializedSingleton instance;

    private LazyInitializedSingleton(){}

    public static LazyInitializedSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LazyInitializedSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

4. Thread Safe Singleton:

package com.journaldev.singleton;

public class ThreadSafeSingleton {

    private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance;

    private ThreadSafeSingleton(){}

    public static synchronized ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

}

public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstanceUsingDoubleLocking() {
    if (instance == null) {
        synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
            }
        }
    }
    return instance;
}

5. Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation:

package com.journaldev.singleton;

public class BillPughSingleton {

    private BillPughSingleton(){}

    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();
    }

    public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}

6. Using Reflection to destroy Singleton Pattern:

package com.journaldev.singleton;

import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;

public class ReflectionSingletonTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EagerInitializedSingleton instanceOne = EagerInitializedSingleton.getInstance();
        EagerInitializedSingleton instanceTwo = null;
        try {
            Constructor[] constructors = EagerInitializedSingleton.class.getDeclaredConstructors();
            for (Constructor constructor : constructors) {
                // This code will destroy the singleton pattern
                constructor.setAccessible(true);
                instanceTwo = (EagerInitializedSingleton) constructor.newInstance();
                break;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(instanceOne.hashCode());
        System.out.println(instanceTwo.hashCode());
    }

}

7. Enum Singleton
package com.journaldev.singleton;

public enum EnumSingleton {

    INSTANCE;

    public static void doSomething() {
        // do something
    }
}
8. Serialization and Singleton

package com.journaldev.singleton;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class SerializedSingleton implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -7604766932017737115L;

    private SerializedSingleton(){}

    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final SerializedSingleton instance = new SerializedSingleton();
    }

    public static SerializedSingleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.instance;
    }

}

package com.journaldev.singleton;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInput;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutput;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;

public class SingletonSerializedTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        SerializedSingleton instanceOne = SerializedSingleton.getInstance();
        ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(
                "filename.ser"));
        out.writeObject(instanceOne);
        out.close();

        // deserialize from file to object
        ObjectInput in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(
                "filename.ser"));
        SerializedSingleton instanceTwo = (SerializedSingleton) in.readObject();
        in.close();

        System.out.println("instanceOne hashCode="+instanceOne.hashCode());
        System.out.println("instanceTwo hashCode="+instanceTwo.hashCode());

    }

}

2. Factory Pattern
The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple subclasses and based on input, we need to return one of the subclasses. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a Class from the client program to the factory class. We can apply a singleton pattern on the factory class or make the factory method static.

Some important points about Factory Design Pattern method are;

We can keep Factory class Singleton or we can keep the method that returns the subclass as static.
Notice that based on the input parameter, different subclass is created and returned. getComputer is the factory method.

Factory Design Pattern Examples in JDK
java.util.Calendar, ResourceBundle and NumberFormat getInstance() methods uses Factory pattern.
valueOf() method in wrapper classes like Boolean, Integer etc.

3. Abstract Factory Pattern
The abstract factory pattern is similar to the factory pattern and is a factory of factories. If you are familiar with the factory design pattern in Java, you will notice that we have a single factory class that returns the different subclasses based on the input provided and the factory class uses if-else or switch statements to achieve this. In the abstract factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each subclass and then an abstract factory class that will return the subclass based on the input factory class.
